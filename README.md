# PythonGame

A fun little custom game project I decided to start on to learn Python because reading the textbook and following the project they give me exactly step-by-step is too boring. Based off of the Alien Invasion project from Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes.

### Why isn't there a cool title for the game?

It's still WIP. Probably something like Felicia's Bizzare Adventure or something idk.

### Who's Felicia?

Felicia the clumsy maid from Fire Emblem: Fates. She's the character you play as in this game. Technically, the code recognizes the character as just "the player", and the Felicia sprite is just kinda slapped on and is totally interchangable.

##### Oh, I couldn't tell who the character was.

~Yeah, I suppose it would help if she wasn't headless. The issue still persists as of writing this (8/21/2018).~ This issue has now been fixed (as of 9/5/2018) you have no reason not to recognize her now ha

### Is throwing daggers at Faceless hordes the only thing that's going to happen in the game?

I kinda have plans for short story sequences? At least something about why Felicia is doing all this anyway. This planned story segment will still lead to fighting Faceless monsters.

And like maybe some sort of map feature where you can travel places? Not too sure how important this is.

Oh and maybe also like a shop to purchase stuff with drops from Faceless monsters. And have Anna run the shop. And if this shop gets in the game, daggers most certainly won't be the only thing Felicia can hurl at Nohr's probably illegal undead army.

### Is there gonna be anything to listen to?

I hope to add some nice 8 bit remixes of tracks from FE: Fates, probably ones that I find on YouTube, maybe I'll figure out how to make my own because the selection on YouTube is pretty limited.
